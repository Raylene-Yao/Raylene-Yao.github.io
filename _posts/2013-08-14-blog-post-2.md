Based on Quansar’s two-degree-of-freedom helicopter, which has two DC motor propellers for controlling pitch angle θ and yaw angle ψ. Discrete-time controllers are designed for each of these two propellers using the root locus method. The two controllers designed are simulated separately using Matlab to analyze and compare the design specifications with the actual simulation results. After ensuring that both controllers meet the design specifications, the pitch and yaw channels are coupled and the resulting effects are compared and analyzed.
