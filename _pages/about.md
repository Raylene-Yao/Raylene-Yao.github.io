I am a recent graduate from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca), having completed my [Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/electrical-engineering-meng.html) at the Gina Cody School in September 2023. My academic journey has been focused on two topic areas, namely Systems and Control, and Computing Systems. In addition to my primary focus, I have also undertaken coursework in Signal Processing, Microelectronic Systems, and Robotics, further enriching my knowledge and skills in the field.

Also, I am a graduate from [Shanghai Institute of Technology](https://www.sit.edu.cn), having completed my Bachelor's degree in Automation from [the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://ee.sit.edu.cn/_t497/main.psp) in July 2020. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I delved into a comprehensive curriculum that encompassed key subjects such as microcomputer principles and interface technology, automatic control theory, principles and application of SCM, electrical control and PLC application technology, database fundamentals, and computer control systems.

After graduating with my undergraduate degree, I embarked on my professional journey at Michelin Tire Research and Development Center (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. As a Assistant Tire Development, I was responsible for a range of key tasks, contributing to the overall development and enhancement of tires. My primary responsibilities involved collaborating with cured tire designers(CTD) and technician guarantee performance(TGP), conduct tire testing, and prepare relevant tire performance test reports. Throughout my tenure at Michelin China, I not only developed a strong foundation in tire development but also had the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams, enhance my problem-solving abilities, and contribute to the innovative and dynamic environment of the company.
