I participated in the in the Preliminary Contest of the East China Division, a Mechanical Engineering Innovation and Creativity Competition for University Students â€“ Intelligent Manufacturing Competition. Our focus was on designing intelligent factories and smart production lines utilizing digital methods. We applied our skills to configure system parameters in accordance with specified requirements, conducted virtual debugging, simulation, and validation of the production line.

Our key objective was to achieve seamless integration between the virtual and real scenarios, demonstrating our ability to bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical implementation in the field of intelligent manufacturing. Through this competition, we showcased our innovation and creativity in the realm of mechanical engineering, contributing to the advancement of intelligent manufacturing processes.
